    <dd>⚽ Football (mostly watching) &nbsp&nbsp|&nbsp&nbsp ♟️ Chess &nbsp&nbsp|&nbsp&nbsp 🏊‍♂️🚴‍♂️🏃‍♂️ Triathlon &nbsp&nbsp|&nbsp&nbsp 📺 watching way too much documentaries on YouTube</dl>

At the moment I'm trying to build a React WebApp that shows the current prices of the ski resorts in Switzerland. 

In the past, I already created a React WebApp in a group work at ETHZ displaying some data about the stock market. See [Market News](###Market-News)

Also I set several Wordpress pages up. See [here](#wordpress-projects)

As I'm a huge Football enjoyer (Soccer), I love to help students in the course Soccer Analytics at ETHZ creating their own project. 
I published some sneak peaks from my own project [below](#soccer-analytics).
