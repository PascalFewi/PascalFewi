In my free time, I explore how to make on-chain prediction market data more accessible and analyzable:

- **Polymarket Orderbook Collector** â€“ Archives Polymarket order book data for analysis.  
  [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/PascalFewi/Polymarket_Orderbook_Collector) â€“ Data coming soon.

- **Polymarket Trading Analytics** â€“ Introduction to the collected data, Analysis Coming soon.  
  [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/PascalFewi/Polymarket_Trading)

Other projects:

- **EM2024 Betting Odds Crawler** â€“ Scrapes betting odds from Swisslos to find optimal bets with friends.  
  [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/PascalFewi/EM2024_BettingOdds_Crawler)

- **Meischter-RÃ¤chnÃ¤r** â€“ A small web app to calculate Swiss football league title chances.
